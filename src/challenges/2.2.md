# Testing Hooks

## Introduction

When you create a custom React hook that can be used by a large amount of components, it's a good idea to test it isolated, untied from a component.

The [`@testing-library/react-hooks`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library) allows us to test hooks, with a testing experience as close as possible to as we would use it within a real component.

## Exercise

In the file `react/useBoredList.test.js`, write the missing tests to the respective custom hook.

This one might be tricky. Pay close attention to üçÄ to guide you. Good luck!
