# Async code

## Introduction

With Jest, we can test asynchronous code in multiple ways. The following cases uses `async` / `await`. Some main differences from traditional tests:

- The Jest global `it()` callback must be `async` so that we can use `await` inside.
- It's recommended to use `expect.assertion(number)` to tell Jest how many assertions are expected before finishing:

```js
// Success async call
it('should wake up eventually', async () => {
  expect.assertions(1)
  const result = await wakeUpAt(10)
  expect(result).toEqual('awake at 10:00!')
})

// Failed async call
it('should not wake up too early', async () => {
  expect.assertions(1)
  await expect(wakeUpAt(6)).rejects.toEqual({
    error: '6:00 is too earlier!',
  })
})
```

An async function result can also be mocked using [`jest.fn().mockResolvedValue()`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/mock-function-api#mockfnmockresolvedvaluevalue).

```js
it('should wake up eventually', async () => {
  const asyncEventMock = jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('success')

  const result = await asyncEventMock()

  expect(result).toBe('success')
})
```

### Dealing with HTTP Requests

The [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch) is a browser feature. Jest tests are run in Node enviroment. That means the tests will break when trying to execute `fetch` because it does not exist in Node.

To solve that problem we need to mock `fetch`, which isn't an easy task. Luckly for us, there's [`jest-fetch-mock`](https://github.com/jefflau/jest-fetch-mock) package that does that for us! (You can look at the package as a _fake_ - a simplified version of fetch).

```js
import fetchMock from 'jest-fetch-mock'

beforeAll(() => {
  // Creates the mock so that it can be asserted later
  fetchMock.enableMocks()
})

it('getRandomAnimal() returns a random fact', async () => {
  const fact = {
    fact: 'The average litter of kittens is between 2 - 6 kittens.',
    length: 55,
  }

  global.fetch.mockResponse(JSON.stringify(fact))

  const result = await getRandomAnimal()

  // Assert the fetch was called with the correct URL
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1)
  expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('https://catfact.ninja/fact', {
    method: 'GET',
  })

  expect(result).toEqual(fact)
})
```

## Exercise

In the file `snippets/boredAPI.test.js`,
you'll test the `boredAPI.js`. This module is a _real world_ module. It means that it deals with a real API that does HTTP requests to [The Bored API](https://www.boredapi.com/) using `fetch`.

Your goal is to complete the tests marked with `it.todo()`

But wait... before you get started, I want to share one last thing: In the test file there's an imported module `activityStub`. What's a better way to learn what a stub is than to see (and use) one directly.

Once you open the file, you'll see the following:

```js
export const activityStub = {
  basic: {
    activity: 'Write a note of appreciation to someone',
    type: 'social',
    participants: 1,
    price: 0,
    link: '',
    key: '1770521',
    accessibility: 0,
  },
  // ...
}
```

**A stub is an object with realistic data.** Usually used as result of a _mocked function_ to test a specific scenario. I love stubs because it helps me (and you) to understand the kind of information is expected from a function. In this exercise, use them to write more realistic tests to `boredAPI`.

```js
// Bad: Writing "foo bar" makes it hard for new developers
// to understand realistically what kind of data is expected
global.fetch.mockResponse(
  JSON.stringify({
    activity: 'hello world',
    key: 'foo',
  })
)

// Good: With stubs, everyone can get a taste of the "real world".
// Usually stubs are a copy from a real request response.
global.fetch.mockResponse(JSON.stringify(activityStub.basic))
```

<!-- TODO prepare boredAPI exercise! -->

## Bonus

### #1 Mock Service Worker

A possible step further when dealing with HTTP is [msw](https://github.com/mswjs/msw). There are some key differences from `jest-fetch-mco`:

- The `fetch` is not mocked. Instead it creates a "mocked" service worker to intercept the requests.
- It supports both `REST` and `GraphQL`.
- The mocks created can live alongside the rest of the app. It can be used for development, unit testing and E2E testing!

That sound promissing, uh?

The setup and most of some of the tests using `msw` are already done for you. Your goal here is just to read directly `boredAPI-msw.solution.test.js` and get to know how is it done. There are still a few `it.todo()` left to be done. You can do them!

If this rings a bell to you, I highly recommend you to read [Stop Mocking fetch](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/stop-mocking-fetch).
