Hi there, welcome! 👋

You are almost ready for a session packed with knowledge! This website contains all the materials needed for the workshop.

We'll talk and practice the following topics:

### Challenges notes:

- All the external packages that we'll talk about are already installed and configured. Your only focus is using them.

- You won't write all the needed tests. Instead, I'll point you to some _strategic tests with bigger learning value_. Here's how you'll know if you should, or not, write a test:

```js
// 🍀 Tests to be done:
it.todo('must work')

// 🍀 Test to be done:
it('will work', () => {
  // This gives you an idea how many assertions are needed
  expect.assertions(3)

  // 🍀 Follow the lucky emoji to help you
})

// 😴 Extra time? Go ahead and complete the skipped tests
it.skip('will work', () => {
  // ...
})
```
