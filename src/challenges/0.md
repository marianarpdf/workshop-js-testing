4. Imported modules <!-- (getAnimal - catcher) -->
5. Test doubles: Fake <!-- (metrics + getAnimal refactor) -->
6. HTTP requests (and Stubs) <!--(boredAPI) -->

### Day 2: React Testing Library

1. Components <!--(ActivityCard) -->
2. Hooks <!--(useBoredList + fake use only) -->
3. Context <!--(BoredContext) -->
4. UI Features <!--(ActivityGenerator) -->
