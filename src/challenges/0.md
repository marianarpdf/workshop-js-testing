Access [JS Testing slides](TODO-LINK) for a theoric complement to this learning journey.

We'll talk and practice the following topics:

### Day 1: Jest

<!-- CONTINUE HERE. REARRANGE ORDER OF EXERCISES -->

1. Initial `expect`ations
2. Test doubles: Mocks <!--(petsGuard, sendTracker) -->
3. Test doubles: Spy <!-- (verifyPetBeforeAdopt + searchPet) -->
4. Imported modules <!-- (getPet) -->
5. Test doubles: Fake <!-- (metrics + getPet refactor) -->
6. Asynchronous code (HTTP request and Stubs) <!--(boredAPI) -->

### Day 2: React Testing Library

1. Components <!--(ActivityCard) -->
2. Hooks <!--(useBoredList + fake use only) -->
3. Context <!--(BoredContext) -->
4. UI Features <!--(ActivityGenerator) -->
5. Going further...
