### Challenges notes:

- You won't write all the needed tests. You'll practice only some **specific ones that give you extra learning value**. Here's how you know if you should, or not, write a test:

```js
// 🍀 Tests to be done:
it.todo('must work')

// 🍀 Test to be done:
it('will work', () => {
  // This gives you an idea how many assertions are needed
  expect.assertions(3)

  // 🍀 Follow the lucky emoji to help you
})

// 😴 Extra time? Go ahead and complete the skipped tests
it.skip('will work', () => {
  // ...
})
```
