# Testing "UI Features"

## Introduction

So far, we've learned to test in React:

- Simple React components
- Hooks (isolated)
- Context (isolated)
- Components that use hooks

The next thing is how to test a complete feature. By feature, I mean a big React component that put a lot of small pieces together to create the final UI.

In this stage we are way above the layer "Unit test". This is a "Integration Testing" and our focus is testing that all pieces work together.

## Exercise

In the file `ActivityGenerator.test.js`,
it's where you'll test the `ActivityGenerator`.

The essential requirements are already described in the test file. Your goal is to complete the `it.todo()`.

Some new RTL Queries you'll use:

- `getByLabelText`
- [`waitForElementToBeRemoved()`](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-async)
- [within()](https://testing-library.com/docs/dom-testing-library/api-helpers#within-and-getqueriesforelement-apis)

<!-- TODO prepare exercise -->

## Bonus

### #1 Interaction simulations

When using `fireEvent`, we are simulating an event, but in a very simplified way. For example, `fireEvent.change()` to change a input, it changes the input directly, but a lot of other things happens, when a real user fills an input. `mouseDown`, `focus`, `mouseUp`, `keydown`, `blur`, etc... It's way more than a "change".

In most cases `fireEvent` works fine, but there are cases when it's not enough, especially when dealing with inputs. That's where [`@testing-library/user-event`](https://github.com/testing-library/user-event) comes into action.

Your goal: Replace `fireEvent` with `useEvent` in this file.

Note: The package is already installed in this project, you just need to import it.

```js
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
```
