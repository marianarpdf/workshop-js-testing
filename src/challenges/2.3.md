# RTL: React Hooks

## Introduction

When you create a custom React hook that can be used by a large amount of components, it's a good idea to test it isolated, untied from a component.

The [`@testing-library/react-hooks`](https://github.com/testing-library/react-hooks-testing-library) allows us to test hooks, with a testing experience as close as possible to as we would use it within a real component.

## Exercise

In the file `react/useBoredList.test.js`, write the missing tests to the respective custom hook.

This one might be tricky. Pay close attention to üçÄ to guide you. Good luck!

## Bonus

### #1 Create `useBoredList` hook

The `component/Footer` uses the hook `useBoredList`. A fellow colleague already started writing the component tests. They decide to mock the hook to keep things simple. A common trade-off, when the hook is complex. However, new bugs can happen and the mock would hide them.

Your goal is to create a fake version oh the hook at `react/__doubles__/useBoredListFake.js` and use it in `Footer.test.js`.
