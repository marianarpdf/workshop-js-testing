# Testing Context

Similar to custom hooks, a React Context can be consumed by a lot of components, so we need the feel to test it isolated.

Unfortunately, there isn't any out-the-box way to test Context in a isolated way as `react-hooks`. Our best solution is to create a "Checkup" component that servers as bridge between the Context and the actual DOM output.

## Introduction

```js
import { ThemeContext, useThemeContext } from 'path/to/ThemeContext'

function ThemeCheckup() {
  const { theme, toggleTheme } = useThemeContext()

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Theme: {theme}</p>
      <button onClick={toggleTheme}>Toggle theme</button>
    </div>
  )
}

it('the theme is light by default', () => {
  render(
    <ThemeContext.Provider>
      <ThemeCheckup />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )

  expect(screen.getByText('Theme:')).toHaveTextContent('Theme: light')
})

it('toggling the theme switches between light and dark', () => {
  render(
    <ThemeContext.Provider>
      <ThemeCheckup />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )

  const getTheme = () => screen.getByText('Theme:').textContent
  const getBtn = () => screen.getByText('Toggle theme')

  // Assert #1 - it's light
  expect(getTheme()).toBe('Theme: light')

  // Act + Assert #2 - it's dark now
  fireEvent.click(getBtn())
  expect(getTheme()).toBe('Theme: dark')

  // Act + Assert #3 - it's light again!
  fireEvent.click(getBtn())
  expect(getTheme()).toBe('Theme: light')
})
```

## Exercise

In the file `BoredContext.test.js`, it's where you'll test the `BoredContext`. A initial test is already done, but some are still missing. Try to complete those with `it.todo()`.

Some things to note:

- **Stubs:** Remember to go beyond _foo data_. There's a module with `activityStubs` (already imported) ready to be used!
- **Dependencies:** Will you mock `boredAPI` and just assert that `getNewActivity` was called? Or will you use the real module and assert directly the `fetch` request? Mocking the module is easier. Asserting the fetch gives you extra confidence. Your choice!

## Bonus

### #1 Using custom wrapper

Probably you duplicated `BoredProvider` across all the renders:

```js
render(
  <BoredProvider>
    <ConsumerCheckup {...customProps} />
  </BoredProvider>
)
```

You can create a custom wrapper using RTL the `wrapper` option to `render`.

```js
const BoredWrapper = ({ children }) => {
  return <BoredProvider>{children}</BoredProvider>
}

const renderBored = (ui, options) =>
  render(ui, { wrapper: BoredWrapper, ...options })

// ...

renderBored(<ConsumerCheckup {...customProps} />)
```

This is useful when you test a lot of component that rely on a higher context, for example a ThemeProvider for CSS-in-JS tools. Check out [Testing Library example](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/setup#custom-render)

### #2 Wow

Did you made it all? Even without mokcing `fetch`? In your free time, you can finish the skipped tests. Oh, and you are ah-wesome! ðŸš€
